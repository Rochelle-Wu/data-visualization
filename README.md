# data-visualization
The data which be visualized is the data of video game sales that the total number is more than 5 million in the whole world. The data link is https://gist.github.com/Rochelle-Wu/6cb1e6fd26fc9980374dac3a98bdc435. The original data is https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales I filter the data because there are some invalid data which can influence the result, and I selected the first 208 data.
# Prototypes
For show the result directly, I draw a bar plot based on the data, the picture is shown as follow. (Due to the size, I just screenshot a part of the bar plot, for more detail, please refer to this link https://vizhub.com/Rochelle-Wu/8efdeac3d2d74c978214f6a12bf669c5) This plot shows the data of video game sales in different platforms.

# Questions
1. From whole data, Which platform sells the most games? 
2. What is the favorite genre for each region?
3. Which does publisher sell the most game (< 5 million)? 

# Sketches
To help answer these questions I've conceptualized a visualization dashboard in the following sketch.
There are three sketches.

For the first plot, we account the data about the sales in differernt platform for the whole world, and the result is shown in first picture. From this picture we can easily know that what the platform is the biggest. What is the second, ... The second picture is about the data counting from the publisher. From this picture, we can know that which pulisher have the most number of game. The third graphy is about the sales number for different types of game in different region. From this plot, we can understand the preferences of different regions for game types.

# Open Questions
I am wondering that if there third graph can be optimzed. For example, we can use one graph to represent single genre of game and total data at the same time. Moreover, if we can have more succinct way to show our data?
