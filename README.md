# data-visualization
The data which be visualized is the data of video game sales that the total number is more than 5 million in the whole world. The data link is https://gist.github.com/Rochelle-Wu/6cb1e6fd26fc9980374dac3a98bdc435. The original data is https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales I filter the data because there are some invalid data which can influence the result, and I selected the first 208 data.
# Prototypes
For show the result directly, I draw a bar plot based on the data, the picture is shown as follow. (Due to the size, I just screenshot a part of the bar plot, for more detail, please refer to this link https://vizhub.com/Rochelle-Wu/8efdeac3d2d74c978214f6a12bf669c5) This plot shows the data of video game sales in different platforms.

# Questions
1. From whole data, what is the performance of the different publisher in different genres? 
2. Which the publisher does sell the most game (> 5 million)? 
3. Which platform does sell the most games? 
4. What is the favorite genre for each region?

# Answer the Question
To help answer these questions I've conceptualized a visualization dashboard in the following sketch.

There are some screenshots and sketches.

Fig 4. The sales data for different publishers in different genres.

We can use Fig.4 to answer the Qustion 1 and 2. In Fig.3 we can know that Nintendo sales the most games, which the number is around 1 billion for all genres. Moreover, the first publisher is 900 millions more than the second publisher, which is nearly 5 times. Then when we click different genres, we can see different results.

Fig 5. The sales data in the Sport.

In this genre, the first publisher still is Nintendo. And there are 6 publishers data is bigger than 5 million. 
Due to the limitation of the space, for other genres' results, please refer to https://vizhub.com/Rochelle-Wu/32291274755c49ada1c3470bb473b543. For other results, we can easily know that Nintendo is shown in every genres, which means that Nintendo has better sales data. However, in some genres the best preformance is other publishers like Activision, Take-Two Interactive.

For the first sketches, we account the data about the sales in differernt platform for the whole world, and the result is shown in first picture. From this picture we can easily know that what the platform is the biggest. What is the second, ... This sketch can answer the Question 3.  The second graphy is about the sales number for different types of game in different region. From this plot, we can understand the preferences of different regions for game types.



# Schedule of deliverables
For the whole project, I have lots of work need to do, like adding interactions, combining different pictures, finding the best method to show the result and so on. 
So I think need more time to plan my final project. 

I expect to finish the basic results by several plots before the first week of November.

Then I will combine these pictures before 10th November.

I will deploy some interactions in my porject before 17th November.

Next, I will migrate from vizhub to github and publish my project with github pages before 24th November.

Finally, I will modify and optimize my project before 1st December.
